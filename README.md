## 🚀 The Journey

This project was born out of my first **Hackathon experience**. It represents a significant milestone in my development journey, where I challenged myself to build a world-class portfolio from scratch.

> [!NOTE]
> **What I Learned:**
> - Deep dive into **React 19** and its latest features.
> - Mastering **Tailwind CSS v4** for complex, custom animations.
> - Implementing smooth scrolling with **Lenis** for that "premium" web feel.
> - The importance of **TypeScript** in maintaining a growing codebase.
> - Most importantly: **Learning by doing.** This entire project was built by reading documentation, experimenting with code, and persistent debugging.
