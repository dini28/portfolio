## The Developer's Journey

This project originated as my **inaugural Hackathon entry**. It stands as a testament to the "learning by building" philosophy. Every line of code was written while exploring documentation, solving architectural challenges, and iterating on visual feedback.

> [!TIP]
> **Key Technical Takeaway:**
> Implementing **Lenis** alongside **Tailwind v4** allowed for a level of fluid animation that was previously difficult to achieve without significant performance overhead.
